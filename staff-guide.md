# ðŸ”¥ Firestarter Staff Guide
This guide outlines everything you need to know as a moderator on Firestarter. Remember, your main job as a moderator is to enforce our rules and be unbaised in your handling of situations.

## Punishment Guideline
These are our standard punishment lengths for bans and mutes on the server. To check for repeated offenses, use `/history <username>`. After banning, if the player is in our Discord, make sure to give them the banned role.

If you need clarification on any of these, please either post in `#staff-chat` or contact an admin. After you have given out a punishment, please post evidence of the offense in the `#evidence` channel on our Discord server. This will help us keep track of punishments in case we need the evidence in the future.
